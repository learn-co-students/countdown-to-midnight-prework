# Guide to Solving Countdown to Midnight

The first error message we are getting after running `rspec` is: 

### `#countdown`

```bash
LOOPS
  #countdown
    outputs '<n> SECOND(S)!' string to STDOUT for each count (FAILED - 1)
    returns HAPPY NEW YEAR! (FAILED - 2)
  #countdown_with_sleep
    should take at least 5 seconds to execute (FAILED - 3)

Failures:

  1) LOOPS #countdown outputs '<n> SECOND(S)!' string to STDOUT for each count
     Failure/Error: expect { countdown(10) }.to output(countdown_output).to_stdout
     ArgumentError:
       wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
```
In the `README` the instructions are to pass in an argument to our method. 
**NOTE:**`Wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)` means our countdown method expects from us that we pass in an argument. 

```ruby
def countdown(seconds_to_midnight)
end
```

The next error message is:

```bash
LOOPS
  #countdown
    outputs '<n> SECOND(S)!' string to STDOUT for each count (FAILED - 1)
    
    Failures:

Again in the instructions it says after passing in the seconds to midnight our method should use a `while-loop` to check if the seconds we passed in are greater than 0, as long as that condition is true, it should countdown the seconds and decrement them every time (we will use the subtract-and-assign operator - explained in the README) the loop runs until 0. When we hit 0 it should say `"HAPPY NEW YEAR"`.

```ruby
def countdown(seconds_to_midnight)
  while seconds_to_midnight > 0
    puts "#{seconds_to_midnight} SECOND(S)!"
    seconds_to_midnight -= 1
  end
  "HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
end
```

### `#countdown_with_sleep`

```bash
#countdown_with_sleep
    should take at least 5 seconds to execute (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) LOOPS #countdown_with_sleep should take at least 5 seconds to execute
     Failure/Error: expect(runtime.real.to_i >= 5).to be true
       
       expected true
            got false

```

This method will also accept an argument and countdown those seconds until we hit 0. 

The `README` specifically asked for the method to take a little bit longer to count down. If you take a look at the benchmark in the tests, you'll notice a benchmark:

```ruby
it 'should take at least 5 seconds to execute' do
  runtime = Benchmark.measure { countdown_with_sleep(5) }
  expect(runtime.real.to_i >= 5).to be true
end
```

The hint in the `README` forwards us to stackoverflow.com which tells us how to make our application sleep.

```ruby
sleep(num_secs)
```


The `sleep(num_sec)` accepts an argument of seconds. The Benchmark in the test is saying that if we pass in `5` has our method argument, the countdown should take 5 or more seconds.

In our `countdown_with_sleep` method we will pass in `1` to the `sleep` method, so our application will only sleep one second between the iterations. 

```ruby
def countdown_with_sleep(seconds_to_midnight)
  while seconds_to_midnight > 0
    puts "#{seconds_to_midnight} SECOND(S)!"
    sleep(1)
    seconds_to_midnight -= 1
  end
  "HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
end
```
Now all our tests should pass.
